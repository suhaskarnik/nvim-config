# Neovim Config

Borrowing heavily from [this excellent Github repo](https://github.com/VonHeikemen/lazy-template)

The `lua` dir contains all the configurations. Within that, `plugins` contains all the plugins I use, and `user` contains my customisations.

If anything gets messed up Neovim, just delete `~/.local/share/nvim/` or rename it, and then run `nvim` again
